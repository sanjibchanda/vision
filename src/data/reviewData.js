      "I have been using various ANC headphones for years and I bought these because my Airpods Pro got spoiled and I forgot my Bose Quiet Control 30s at home while traveling. It looks pretty good with impressive fit and finish. The buttons feel well built yet the headphone is quite light. It did not hurt my ears even after long hours of continuous use.",
